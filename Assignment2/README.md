## **Project Setup**

This guide explains how we configure the project environment, perform data processing, train the model, and use the model for prediction.

---

## **1. Environment Setup**

### **Using Conda**

To set up the project environment using Conda, we follow these steps:

1. **Install Conda**:
   - We first ensure that Conda is installed on our system. We can download it from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or use Miniconda.
   
2. **Create a Conda environment**:
   We create a new Conda environment for the project using the following command:
   ```bash
   conda create --name crop_yield_prediction python=3.8
   ```

3. **Activate the environment**:
   We activate the newly created environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate crop_yield_prediction
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies**:
   We install the necessary Python libraries specified in the project using the following Conda or pip commands:
   ```bash
   conda install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn  # For handling imbalanced datasets (SMOTE)
   ```

5. **Optional**: If we are using Jupyter Notebooks for the project:
   ```bash
   conda install jupyterlab
   ```

6. **Clone the project repository**:
   If the project code is stored in a repository (e.g., GitHub), we can clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

## **2. Data Processing**

### **Processing the Dataset**

We begin by processing the dataset to prepare it for analysis and model training. The following steps outline the process:

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   We load the dataset using Pandas:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('path/to/dataset.csv')
   ```

2. **Handle Missing Values**:
   We check for and handle missing values in the dataset:
   ```python
   # Fill missing numerical values with the mean
   df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
   
   # Fill missing categorical values with the mode
   for col in df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns:
       df[col].fillna(df[col].mode()[0], inplace=True)
   ```

3. **Normalize the Data**:
   We scale the numerical features to ensure consistency in the data using **StandardScaler**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

   scaler = StandardScaler()
   df[['Temperature', 'Precipitation', 'CO2 Levels']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Temperature', 'Precipitation', 'CO2 Levels']])
   ```

4. **Feature Engineering**:
   We create additional features, such as interaction terms between variables, to improve model performance:
   ```python
   df['Temp_Precip_Interaction'] = df['Temperature'] * df['Precipitation']
   ```

5. **Split the Data**:
   We split the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation:
   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   X = df[['Temperature', 'Precipitation', 'CO2 Levels', 'Temp_Precip_Interaction']]
   y = df['Crop Yield']

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
   ```

## **3. Model Training**

We now train our machine learning model using the processed dataset.

### **Linear Regression Example**:

1. **Train the Model**:
   We use **Linear Regression** as our initial model for predicting crop yield:
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

   # Initialize and train the model
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)

   # Predict on the test set
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

   # Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
   print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
   ```

2. **Alternative Models**:
   We also experiment with more advanced models such as **Ridge Regression**, **Polynomial Regression**, and **Gradient Boosting** for better performance. See the corresponding sections of the code for these models.

---

## **4. Using the Model for Prediction**

Once the model has been trained and evaluated, we can use it for predictions on new or unseen data.

### **Steps for Prediction**:

1. **Load the New Data**:
   We load the new dataset (which must be in the same format as the training data):
   ```python
   new_data = pd.read_csv('path/to/new_data.csv')
   ```

2. **Preprocess the New Data**:
   We preprocess the new data similarly to how we processed the training data (handle missing values, normalize, and feature engineer):
   ```python
   new_data[['Temperature', 'Precipitation', 'CO2 Levels']] = scaler.transform(new_data[['Temperature', 'Precipitation', 'CO2 Levels']])
   new_data['Temp_Precip_Interaction'] = new_data['Temperature'] * new_data['Precipitation']
   ```

3. **Make Predictions**:
   We use the trained model to make predictions:
   ```python
   predictions = model.predict(new_data)
   print(predictions)
   ```

## **Conclusion**

This README has outlined the steps for setting up the environment, processing the data, training the machine learning model, and using the model for predictions. For further experimentation, we can adjust the model and explore additional machine learning algorithms. Make sure to validate the model's performance using cross-validation and tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.
